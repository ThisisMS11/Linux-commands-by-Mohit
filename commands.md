```
ls -l file_name
```

Rewriting permissions
```
chmod u=rwx, g=rx, o=r file_name
```
* u=user, g=group, o=other || r=read, w=write, x=execute

Rewriting permissions using octal numbers
Divided into three categories:
4 = read,  2 = write, 1 = execute

chmod 777 filename

! 7=(4+2+1)  
you got it i know.
